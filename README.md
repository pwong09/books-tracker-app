#### An app to track the books you've read!
This app utilizes Google Books API to allow all users to search for books by title, author, category, publisher, or isbn. Using OAuth to authenticate, authenticated users have access to their personal Shelf. They can view, add, edit, or remove books they've read. They can also view, add, edit, or delete reviews and notes.
